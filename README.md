# Capstone Project - TimeTable Scheduler
Timetable scheduling, a critical challenge in various domains such as education especially, has witnessed substantial enhancements through the integration of dynamic constraints.

Unlike traditional static scheduling, dynamic constraints consider evolving factors and real-time information, resulting in more adaptable and efficient schedules. Through the utilization of dynamic constraints, scheduling systems can now account for unforeseen disruptions, resource fluctuations, and time-sensitive variables, ushering in a new era of intelligent and responsive timetable management.

The project aims to create an efficient Timetable scheduler using heuristic and machine learning algorithms. This system optimizes scheduling decisions to generate high- quality timetables that satisfy specified constraints.

This system aims to create a balanced and equitable teaching and learning environment, which can greatly enhance the overall experience of teachers and students. Ultimately, our objective is to streamline the timetable creation process, enabling educators to focus on delivering high-quality education and maximizing student outcomes.
